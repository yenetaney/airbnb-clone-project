## Database Design  

Each entity in the backend is designed to maintain structured relationships to ensure efficient data management. Below is an overview of how they connect:  

### ðŸ”¹ User & Property  
- A **User** (host) can list **multiple Properties**.  
- Each **Property** is owned by **one host (User)**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Property & Booking  
- A **guest (User)** can book a **Property**.  
- A **Property** can have **multiple Bookings** from different users.  
- Each **Booking** belongs to **one specific Property**.  

### ðŸ”¹ User & Booking  
- A **guest (User)** can make **multiple Bookings**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to **one guest (User)**.  
- A **host (User)** can have **multiple Bookings** for their listed Properties.  

### ðŸ”¹ Booking & Payment  
- Each **Booking** is linked to **one Payment**.  
- A **guest (User)** makes the **Payment** for the booking.  
- A **Payment** belongs to **one specific Booking**.  

### ðŸ”¹ User & Review  
- A **guest** can leave **one Review** per **Property** they booked.  
- A **Property** can have **multiple Reviews** from different guests.  
- A **Review** is linked to **one Property** and **one User**.  
# Feature Breakdown
#### **User Management**
This feature enables users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles securely. Hosts can list properties, while guests can browse, book, and interact with listings, ensuring smooth access and personalized experiences.

#### **Property Management**
Hosts can create, update, and manage their property listings, including descriptions, prices, and availability. This ensures that users can find well-organized property options tailored to their needs.

#### **Booking System**
Guests can reserve properties for specific dates, view booking details, and manage their reservations. This feature guarantees a seamless process for securing stays while preventing double bookings.

#### **Payment Processing**
Integrated payment solutions allow guests to make secure transactions for their bookings. This feature ensures financial security, records payment details, and provides transparency for users.

#### **Review & Rating System**
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties theyâ€™ve stayed in, helping future guests make informed choices. Hosts can respond to reviews, fostering trust and engagement within the platform.

#### **Data Optimization & Security**
Efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms ensure fast performance, while encryption and authentication protocols protect user information. This helps maintain reliability, privacy, and seamless functionality.

# API Security
### **1. Authentication**
**Purpose:** Ensures that only legitimate users can access the system by requiring secure login credentials (e.g., passwords, OAuth, or multi-factor authentication).  
**Why Itâ€™s Crucial:** Protects user accounts from unauthorized access, preventing identity theft and data breaches.

### **2. Authorization**
**Purpose:** Controls user permissions, ensuring guests, hosts, and admins can only access functionalities relevant to their roles.  
**Why Itâ€™s Crucial:** Prevents unauthorized actions such as guests modifying listings or accessing sensitive data.

### **3. Rate Limiting & Throttling**
**Purpose:** Limits the number of requests a user can make in a set period to prevent **DDoS attacks** and excessive server load.  
**Why Itâ€™s Crucial:** Protects the system from **malicious bots**, spam, and overuse, ensuring fair access and stable performance.

##  CI/CD Pipelines  

### **What is CI/CD?**  
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deploying applications. It ensures that updates are delivered efficiently and with minimal risk, improving **development speed** and **system reliability**.  

### **Why CI/CD is Important for This Project**  
- **Automated Testing** â€“ Ensures code quality and prevents bugs from reaching production.  
- **Efficient Deployment** â€“ Reduces manual work by automating deployment steps.  
- **Consistent Builds** â€“ Guarantees that every version deployed is stable and reproducible.  
- **Quick Rollbacks** â€“ Makes reverting to a previous version seamless if issues arise.  

### **Tools Used for CI/CD**  
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ Automates workflows, including testing and deployment.  
- **Docker** â€“ Containerizes applications, making them portable across environments.  
- **Jenkins** â€“ Provides customizable automation for build and deployment processes.  
- **CircleCI** â€“ A cloud-based CI/CD solution for rapid integration and testing.  
- **Kubernetes** â€“ Helps manage containerized applications for scalable deployment.  

By implementing CI/CD, the project ensures **smooth development cycles**, **fast deployments**, and **maintained code quality**.
